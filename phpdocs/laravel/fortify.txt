Fortify Features
    'features' => [
        Features::registration(),
        Features::resetPasswords(),
        Features::emailVerification(),
    ],

Disabling Views
    within your application's config/fortify.php configuration file to false:
    'views' => false,
    
Disabling Views & Password Reset
    define a route named password.reset that is responsible for displaying your application's "reset password" view. 
    This is necessary because Laravel's Illuminate\Auth\Notifications\ResetPassword notification will generate the password reset URL via the password.reset named route.

Authentication
    Laravel\Fortify\Fortify class. 
    Typically, you should call this method from the boot method of your application's App\Providers\FortifyServiceProvider class. 

    use Laravel\Fortify\Fortify;    
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Fortify::loginView(function () {
            return view('auth.login');
        });
    
        // ...
    }

    The /login endpoint expects a string email / username and a password. 
    The name of the email / username field should match the username value within the config/fortify.php configuration file. 
    In addition, a boolean remember field may be provided

    Customizing User Authentication
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Fortify::authenticateUsing(function (Request $request) {
            $user = User::where('email', $request->email)->first();
    
            if ($user &&
                Hash::check($request->password, $user->password)) {
                return $user;
            }
        });
    
        // ...
    }

    If login, redirect to home configuration option within config/fortify.php
