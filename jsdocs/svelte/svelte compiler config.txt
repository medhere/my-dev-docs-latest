module:...compilerOptions

option				default		description
filename			null		string used for debugging hints and sourcemaps. Your bundler plugin will set it automatically.
name				"Component"	string that sets the name of the resulting JavaScript class (though the compiler will rename it if it would otherwise conflict with other variables in scope). It will normally be inferred from filename.
format				"esm"		If "esm", creates a JavaScript module (with import and export). If "cjs", creates a CommonJS module (with require and module.exports), which is useful in some server-side rendering situations or for testing.
generate			"dom"		If "dom", Svelte emits a JavaScript class for mounting to the DOM. If "ssr", Svelte emits an object with a render method suitable for server-side rendering. If false, no JavaScript or CSS is returned; just metadata.
errorMode			"throw"		If "throw", Svelte throws when a compilation error occurred. If "warn", Svelte will treat errors as warnings and add them to the warning report.
varsReport			"strict"	If "strict", Svelte returns a variables report with only variables that are not globals nor internals. If "full", Svelte returns a variables report with all detected variables. If false, no variables report is returned.
dev					FALSE		If true, causes extra code to be added to components that will perform runtime checks and provide debugging information during development.
immutable			FALSE		If true, tells the compiler that you promise not to mutate any objects. This allows it to be less conservative about checking whether values have changed.
hydratable			FALSE		If true when generating DOM code, enables the hydrate: true runtime option, which allows a component to upgrade existing DOM rather than creating new DOM from scratch. When generating SSR code, this adds markers to <head> elements so that hydration knows which to replace.
legacy				FALSE		If true, generates code that will work in IE9 and IE10, which don't support things like element.dataset.
accessors			FALSE		If true, getters and setters will be created for the component's props. If false, they will only be created for readonly exported values (i.e. those declared with const, class and function). If compiling with customElement: true this option defaults to true.
customElement		FALSE		If true, tells the compiler to generate a custom element constructor instead of a regular Svelte component.
tag					null		A string that tells Svelte what tag name to register the custom element with. It must be a lowercase alphanumeric string with at least one hyphen, e.g. "my-element".
css					TRUE		If true, styles will be included in the JavaScript class and injected at runtime. It's recommended that you set this to false and use the CSS that is statically generated, as it will result in smaller JavaScript bundles and better performance.
cssHash				See right	A function that takes a { hash, css, name, filename } argument and returns the string that is used as a classname for scoped CSS. It defaults to returning svelte-${hash(css)}
loopGuardTimeout	0			A number that tells Svelte to break the loop if it blocks the thread for more than loopGuardTimeout ms. This is useful to prevent infinite loops. Only available when dev: true
preserveComments	FALSE		If true, your HTML comments will be preserved during server-side rendering. By default, they are stripped out.
preserveWhitespace	FALSE		If true, whitespace inside and between elements is kept as you typed it, rather than removed or collapsed to a single space where possible.
sourcemap			object | string		An initial sourcemap that will be merged into the final output sourcemap. This is usually the preprocessor sourcemap.
enableSourcemap		boolean | { js: boolean; css: boolean; }		If true, Svelte generate sourcemaps for components. Use an object with js or css for more granular control of sourcemap generation. By default, this is true.
outputFilename		null		A string used for your JavaScript sourcemap.
cssOutputFilename	null		A string used for your CSS sourcemap.
sveltePath			"svelte"	The location of the svelte package. Any imports from svelte or svelte/[module] will be modified accordingly.
namespace			"html"		The namespace of the element; e.g., "mathml", "svg", "foreign".
